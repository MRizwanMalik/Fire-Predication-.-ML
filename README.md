Machine Learning Model Deployment with Flask
This repository contains code for deploying a machine learning model using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The deployed model predicts [insert what the model predicts here].

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Python (version >= 3.6)
Flask
Pickle (Python module)
Installation
Clone the repo
sh

# Run the Flask app
sh
Copy code
python app.py
# Usage
After running the Flask app locally, navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
You will see a form where you can input values for [describe the inputs].
Submit the form, and the predicted result will be displayed.
